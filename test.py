# Step 1. Install Python and pip on your Raspberry Pi if not already installed.

# Step 2. Install the Py-SDS011 library to interact with the SDS011 sensor. You can do this with pip:

# bash
# Copy code
# pip install py-sds011
# Step 3. Write a Python script to read data from the sensor. You may use the following example:

# python
# Copy code
import time
from sds011 import SDS011

sensor = SDS011("/dev/ttyUSB0", use_query_mode=True)

time.sleep(10)  # Allow extra time for the sensor to fully power on and initialize
sensor.sleep(sleep=False)  # Turn off sleep mode if in sleep mode
time.sleep(10)  # Allow time for the sensor to wake up

while True:
    pmtwofive, pmten = sensor.query()
    print("PM2.5:", pmtwofive, ", PM10:", pmten)
    time.sleep(1)

# This script will print out PM2.5 and PM10 values every second.

# Step 4. Next, you'll need a way to store this data to plot it later. A simple solution could be to store the data in a CSV file.

# python
# Copy code

import csv
import time
from sds011 import SDS011

sensor = SDS011("/dev/ttyUSB0", use_query_mode=True)
time.sleep(10)
sensor.sleep(sleep=False)
time.sleep(10)

with open('sensor_data.csv', mode='w') as sensor_data:
    data_writer = csv.writer(sensor_data, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)

    while True:
        pmtwofive, pmten = sensor.query()
        data_writer.writerow([time.time(), pmtwofive, pmten])
        time.sleep(1)

        
# Step 5. To display this data, you can use a JavaScript library like Chart.js. You'd need to host a webpage on your Raspberry Pi. You could use Flask to create a simple web server.

# In the Flask app, you'll read the CSV file and convert it into JSON format that can be fetched from the front-end.

# Step 6. In the frontend, you'll use AJAX to fetch the data and Chart.js to plot the data.

# Step 7. For real-time updates, you could either refresh the page periodically or use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push updates to the front-end in real time.
